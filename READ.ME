This directory gets automounted in vagrant VMs as /vagrant, so you can use it to share files between your host and the VM.
Contents:
    `Vagrantfile` is a configuration file for the VM. It is used by Vagrant to set up the VM. You can read more about it [here](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/vagrantfile/).
    `settings.yml` is a configuration file for the VM. It is used by Vagrant to set up the VM. You can read more about it [here](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/vagrantfile/).
    `configs` contains configuration files generated during the cluster setup and are needed for the cluster to work and for your review (should you need it).
    `scripts` contains scripts used to set up the cluster.

Please check `Vagrantfile` and `settings.yml` before running `vagrant up` to make sure the configuration is correct.
